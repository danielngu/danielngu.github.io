<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>I have spent weeks in the desert, forgetting to look at the moon, he says, as a
married man may spend days never looking into the face of his wife. These are
not sins of omission but signs of preoccupation.

She opened the book. The pages were joined together in a stiff wave. She felt
like Crusoe finding a drowned book that had washed up and dried itself on the
shore.

For echo is the soul of the voice exciting itself in hollow places.

The noise of the trees, the breaking of moon into silver fish bouncing off the
leaves of asters outside.

She walks down the hall and climbs into her hammock, giving it a swing as she
leaves the ground.

Moments before sleep are when she feels most alive, leaping across fragments of
the day, bringing each moment into the bed with her like a child with
schoolbooks and pencils. The day seems to have no order until these times, which
are like a ledger for her, her body full of stories and situations. Caravaggio
has for instance given her something. His motive, a drama, and a stolen image.

He said nothing, unable even to turn his head towards her, but his fingers
slipped into her white hand, and when she bent forward to him he put his dark
fingers into her hair and felt it cool within the valley of his fingers.</code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>It is a sort of requirement that a doctor whenever possible be reading or at
least looking down at something on his clipboard when addressing a subordinate,
so the doctor was looking studiously at the patientâ€™s Intake and the sheaf of
charts and records Med-Netted over from trauma and psych wards in some other
city hospitals.</code></pre></figure>

<h3 id="high-fidelity"><a name="hornby-1"></a>HIGH FIDELITY</h3>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span></span>It seems to me that if you place music (and books, probably, and films, and
plays, and anything that makes you feel) at the centre of your being, then you
can&#39;t afford to sort out your love life, start to think of it as the finished
product. You&#39;ve got to pick at it, keep it alive and in turmoil, you&#39;ve got to
pick at it and unravel it until it all comes apart and you&#39;re compelled to start
all over again. Maybe we all live life at too high a pitch, those of us who
absorb emotional things all day, and as a consequence we can never feel merely
content: we have to be unhappy, or ecstatically, head-over-heels happy, and
those states are difficult to achieve within a stable, solid relationship.</code></pre></figure>
